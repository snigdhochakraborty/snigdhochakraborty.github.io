The 2015 Noble Prize in Physics was declared for the discovery of neutrino oscillations. I was in my 10th grade, preparing for my boards. The news seemed to me like any ordinary news headline,
but since it had something to do with 'Physics' intrigued me the most. I was always that kid who would browse through web pages to find out the meaning to new words since the first broadband connection 
came home. 'Neutrino' wasn't an exception to this habit of mine! Now when I look back, it surprises me how being a 16 years old kid I was curious and wanted to learn and to know about a realm that seemed 
completely gibberish to me. This marked the beginning of my journey in particle physics.

Here in this page I would like to document some core concepts in particle physics, that I've learnt in this entire journey of mine. This page is more of a begginers guide to particle physics.
A more theoretical understanding of the field can be found on my [<b>Quantum Field Theory</b>](http://127.0.0.1:4000/qft/) page.
