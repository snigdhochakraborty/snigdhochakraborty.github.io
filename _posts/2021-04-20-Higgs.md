<p>This post is going to be a little different from the other posts on my page till now. I intend to provide a more theoretical insight into Higgs Physics. The post is still going to be very basic in terms of level of understanding, however it might require a bit of an expertise in basic linear algebra, group theory, intermediate level classical mechanics, special relativity and quantum mechanics. I intend to write a future blog on the Experimental Side of Higgs Physics too, but that is for another time. Without any further delay lets get started with our new journey of understanding the Higgs!</p>

As I discussed in my past blog posts [The Standard Model and Beyond](https://snigdhochakraborty.github.io/SUSY/), and [What's SUSY all about?](https://snigdhochakraborty.github.io/susy_rpv/), Higgs was the last piece of puzzle to be found that completed the Standard Model on the 4th of April,2012. But today, we are going to take a look what it actually means when we say things like: 'The Higgs Field gives mass to all the fundamental particles' or, 'the Higgs boson, quanta of the Higgs Field has a mass of 124GeV due Higgs self coupling/interaction.' on a theoretical ground. Although this post shall focus on the Higgs Field or the Higgs Boson, we are going to discuss in here about a lot of general stuff applicable for all other fermions/bosons in order to provide a basic understanding!

<h2>Prelude</h2>
 The Standard Model comprises of fermions, the matter particles, and the bosons, the force carriers. Each boson in the standard model is known to provide some quantum number (kind of an identification number) to each of the fermions. the interaction with the gluon fields is what gives quarks theire color charge. Similarly the interaction with the photon field gives rise to electrical charge, and the interaction with the weak force fields (the W, and the Z boson fields) give rise to the weak isospin charge to all the fermions. But the standard model without the Higgs predicts that all the gauge bosons in the standard model should be massless. However it was found from the  [UA1 and UA2](https://public-archive.web.cern.ch/en/research/UA1_UA2-en.html) experiments at CERNâ€™s Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) in 1983 that infact the <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=Z^{0}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Z^{0}" title="Z^{0}" /></a>, and <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=W^{\pm}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?W^{\pm}" title="W^{\pm}" /></a> bosons do have large mass of around 91 GeV and 80GeV respectively. The puzzle was solved with the introduction of a new scalar field into the theory the Higgs Field, whose excitation gives rise to the Higgs boson. Perhaps there is question to why the fermions have mass, because the standard model for a different reason predicts that they should also be massless, and they are not. But that is a different question and we'll come to that too eventually. So let's get started!
<h2>The Lagrangian method to understand Quantum Fields</h2>
<p>This is a very interesting and simple outline to a method in mathematics that shall help us in understanding Quantum Field in order to answer the question: why or how the Higgs field has such a dramatic effect in changing the masses of the particles from 0 to the ones we observe.<br>
In classical physics when we describe the mechanics of a system, we often use what is called the 'Lagrangian'. It is just a function that summarizes you about the dynamics of the system, and allows you to solve what is actually going on. It is written by taking the Kinetic energy of a system, and subtracting from it the potential energy of the system: <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=L=T-V" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?L=T-V" title="L=T-V" /></a>. In classical physics, generally <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=T" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?T" title="T" /></a>, and <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=V" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?V" title="V" /></a> are functions of position and velocity. Then, we can apply what we call the Euler Equation on the Lagrangian, to derive its equations of motion. In classical mechanics it is written as:<br>
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\boxed{\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial&space;L}{\partial\dot{x}}\right)-\frac{\partial&space;L}{\partial&space;x}=0}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\boxed{\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial&space;L}{\partial\dot{x}}\right)-\frac{\partial&space;L}{\partial&space;x}=0}" title="\boxed{\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial\dot{x}}\right)-\frac{\partial L}{\partial x}=0}" /></a><br>
 These two equations, are the only ones we need to solve a system. </p> In case you are not already familiar with Lagrangian dynamics that I summarized here, you can refer to the notes and the example in here to understand what it actualy means: [Notes](http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~djmorin/chap6.pdf), [Pendulum Example](http://www.aoengr.com/Dynamics/LagrangianMechanicsPendulum.pdf). Now, when we come to the Standard Model, we will be dealing with fields and not solid objects as we saw previously. Moreover these are going to be Quantum Fields and not classical Fields. But it turns out there exists a similar kind of approach, a Lagrangian method, applicable to quantum fields as well. I would simply ask you to trust me and accept it without going into much of a detail. 
 <p>But before getting into that let me try to answer a few questions that might have cropped into your mind.
<ul>
 <li>What kinds of fields will we be talking about?</li>
 <li>How can we have a Lagrangian for a field?</li>
 <li>How can a field have Kinetic and Potential energy?</li>
 </ul>
 So, as we discussed before, the particles in the Standard Model are simply the excitation of their respective fields. These fields are present in all of space, even in empty space (having a value of 0). If energy is given to it to excite it, it can produce ripples, or disturbances from its zero value (the particle). The mss of the particle will come from some of the energy we give by Einstein's famous equation <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=E=mc^2" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?E=mc^2" title="E=mc^2" /></a>. So, we are going to be interested in a lots of different fields, which break down into three main types:<ul><li>Fermion Field: When excited will form a Spin-1/2 particle. Eg: The Electron field</li>
<li>Vector Field: When excited will form a Spin-1 particle (a Gauge Boson). Eg: The Photon field or the Electromagnetic field</li>
<li>Scalar Field: When excited will form a Spin-0 particle (Scalar Boson). Eg: The Higgs field</li></ul>
The first of these the <b>Fermion field</b> or better known as the <b>Dirac Field</b>. These are represented by <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\psi" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\psi" title="\psi" /></a>. This describes the lepton and the quark fields that produce spin-1/2 particle upon excitation. The Dirac Equation, was the first equation to marry special relativity and quantum mechanics sensibly. The Dirac equation can be written down as:<br>
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\boxed{i\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu\psi-m\psi=0}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\boxed{i\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu\psi-m\psi=0}" title="\boxed{i\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu\psi-m\psi=0}" /></a><br>
I donot want you at this stage to get intimidated by this equation. I donot expect you to understand what this equation means at this stage, rather just want you to realize that here <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\psi" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\psi" title="\psi" /></a> is a fermionic field, which upon excitation produces a fermion of mass <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=m" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m" title="m" /></a>. Quickly moving on to the <b>Vector Field</b>, that is the fields for Spin-1 bosons. If we say talk about electromagnetic field: denoted by <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=A" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?A" title="A" /></a>. We can use the Maxwell's equationsas we shall see in a minute to derive the value of electric and magnetic field at a point from the information stored in  <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=A" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?A" title="A" /></a>, which we can measure. Clearly the <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=A" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?A" title="A" /></a> field is not just a number that gives a value at any <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=(x,y,z)" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?(x,y,z)" title="(x,y,z)" /></a>. It also has to describe the direction of this special kind of field at at any point, in space and time. It is known as the  Electromagnetic 4 potential: with <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=A_\mu\equiv(A_0,\vec{A})" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?A_\mu\equiv(A_0,\vec{A})" title="A_\mu\equiv(A_0,\vec{A})" /></a>. <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=A_0" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?A_0" title="A_0" /></a> is the electric scalar potential, and <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\vec{A}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\vec{A}" title="\vec{A}" /></a> is the magnetic vector potential with 3-components along the coordinate axes. This four vector <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=A_\mu" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?A_\mu" title="A_\mu" /></a> is all we need to describe all electromagnetic phenomena. It means that although the electromagnetic field <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=A" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?A" title="A" /></a> is zero everywhere, its excitation produces the electromagnetic waves, or photons. <br>The Maxwell's equations to calculate the Electric and the Magnetic Fields: <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\boxed{\vec{B}=\nabla\times\vec{A}}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\boxed{\vec{B}=\nabla\times\vec{A}}" title="\boxed{\vec{B}=\nabla\times\vec{A}}" /></a>             <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\boxed{\vec{E}=\nabla\varphi-\frac{\partial\vec{A}}{\partial&space;t}}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\boxed{\vec{E}=\nabla\varphi-\frac{\partial\vec{A}}{\partial&space;t}}" title="\boxed{\vec{E}=\nabla\varphi-\frac{\partial\vec{A}}{\partial t}}" /></a><br></p>
Now, before we go on to discussing the next kind of field, it is important to understand what we mean by the term 'Gauge' when we say 'Gauge bosons' or 'Gauge Fields' or 'Gauge Theory'. The values of the field that can be measured, <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\vec{E}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\vec{E}" title="\vec{E}" /></a> and <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\vec{B}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\vec{B}" title="\vec{B}" /></a> are not dependent on certain changes in the electromagnetic four potential <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=A_\mu" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?A_\mu" title="A_\mu" /></a>. What it means is we can tweak the value of <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=A_\mu" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?A_\mu" title="A_\mu" /></a> unders some constraints and still get the same answers for the measurables. To give you an example, say we have a scalar function <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\alpha(t,x,y,z)" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\alpha(t,x,y,z)" title="\alpha(t,x,y,z)" /></a>, and we change <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=A_\mu&space;\equiv&space;(\varphi,\vec{A})" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?A_\mu&space;\equiv&space;(\varphi,\vec{A})" title="A_\mu \equiv (\varphi,\vec{A})" /></a> as:<br>
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\varphi\rightarrow\varphi-\frac{\partial\alpha}{\partial&space;t}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\varphi\rightarrow\varphi-\frac{\partial\alpha}{\partial&space;t}" title="\varphi\rightarrow\varphi-\frac{\partial\alpha}{\partial t}" /></a> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\vec{A}\rightarrow&space;\vec{A}&space;&plus;&space;\nabla&space;a" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\vec{A}\rightarrow&space;\vec{A}&space;&plus;&space;\nabla&space;a" title="\vec{A}\rightarrow \vec{A} + \nabla a" /></a><br>
We will then have a totally new value of <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=A_\mu" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?A_\mu" title="A_\mu" /></a>, but putting this into Maxwell's equations that we saw previously, we derive the same value of <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\vec{B}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\vec{B}" title="\vec{B}" /></a>, and <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\vec{E}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\vec{E}" title="\vec{E}" /></a>. We say that the field <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=A_\mu" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?A_\mu" title="A_\mu" /></a> is <b>gauge invariant</b>, or we can choose a different gauge (add or subtract different things and still get the same answer to the measurables!). Another word for this is  <b>Gauge Symmetry</b>. Even though nothing changes, if we add or subtract some terms ins the equation, it turns out that some choices give us a cleaner and easier way to work out the calculations. So, this gauge invariance is not what we find just in gauge fields, it can be found elsewhere too.

<p>The last kind of field we are going to look at is the <b>Scalar Field</b>, or the Higgs Field. For this we will use the symbol <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\phi" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\phi" title="\phi" /></a>. There is no direction at any point, we just have a value at a particular point. So, now we have an idea about what kind of fields we are going to talk about. This brings us to the second question: How can we have a Lagrangian for a field? But how can we write anything down for kinectic energy or potential energy of <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\psi" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\psi" title="\psi" /></a>, &nbsp; <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=A_\mu" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?A_\mu" title="A_\mu" /></a>, &nbsp; or <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\phi" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\phi" title="\phi" /></a></p>. A field stretches over all space, so we cannot write its energy down as we did for the case of classical systems. So we need to figure a way out! So we use what we call the Lagrangian density, denoted by <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\mathcal{L}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\mathcal{L}" title="\mathcal{L}" /></a>. So, we are considering here, the KE, or the PE per unit volume of a field (Although here volume refers to something non-trivial, its not the spatial volume, rather the volume of space-time). This shall bring us to the next question: How can a field have Potential Energy or a Kinetic Energy? Potential energy as we know is some kind of a 'stored energy'. But how much energy is stored in a field? We propose that amount of energy stored in a field is  proportional to the value of the field squared. I cannot give a proof of this at this stage, however can help motivating it from a simple electroststic example of parallel plate capacitor, where the energy per unit volume stored in between the two plates in form of electric field is given by: <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\frac{\epsilon_0&space;E^2}{2}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{\epsilon_0&space;E^2}{2}" title="\frac{\epsilon_0 E^2}{2}" /></a>. So if in future we write a lagrangian with a part that looks like <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\frac{\phi^2}{2}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{\phi^2}{2}" title="\frac{\phi^2}{2}" /></a>, it shouldn't be a surprse. Coming to kinetic energy, it is weird that we are not talking about particles, or objects moving around here and there, rather it is a field. How can a field have KE? Not just that we should be able to write down KE per unit volume of space-time. Just like for an object KE has to do with how its position changes with time, so for a field KE is how the field changes with spacetime. So, changes in the value of the field in spacetime is what we will take as the kinetic energy of the field. So, the kinetic energy part in the lagrangian will have terms that  somewhat looks like: <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=(\partial\phi/\partial&space;t)^2" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?(\partial\phi/\partial&space;t)^2" title="(\partial\phi/\partial t)^2" /></a> - <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=(\partial\phi/\partial&space;x)^2" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?(\partial\phi/\partial&space;x)^2" title="(\partial\phi/\partial x)^2" /></a>- <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=(\partial\phi/\partial&space;y)^2" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?(\partial\phi/\partial&space;y)^2" title="(\partial\phi/\partial y)^2" /></a> - <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=(\partial\phi/\partial&space;z)^2" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?(\partial\phi/\partial&space;z)^2" title="(\partial\phi/\partial z)^2" /></a>. I have not considered constants in this equation. This is certinly not a simple idea, atleast not as simple as it might seem. However, for our purposes, this works quite well. In order to condense the kinetic energy part by using the einstein summation notation: <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=(\partial_\mu\phi)^2" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?(\partial_\mu\phi)^2" title="(\partial_\mu\phi)^2" /></a>, or <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\partial^\mu\phi\partial_\mu\phi" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\partial^\mu\phi\partial_\mu\phi" title="\partial^\mu\phi\partial_\mu\phi" /></a>.

<h2>A Scalar Lagrangian</h2>
<p>From the discussion above, it should not be a matter of surprise that I can write the Lagrangian density of a scalar field as <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\boxed{\mathcal{L}&space;=&space;\frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu\phi)^2-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{mc^2}{\hbar}\right)^2\phi^2}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\boxed{\mathcal{L}&space;=&space;\frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu\phi)^2-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{mc^2}{\hbar}\right)^2\phi^2}" title="\boxed{\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu\phi)^2-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{mc^2}{\hbar}\right)^2\phi^2}" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, in these kinds of equations the constants that we see here in the potential energy part might seem quite unintuitive. In units we use in particle physics, we genrally set <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=c=\hbar=1" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?c=\hbar=1" title="c=\hbar=1" /></a>. Also, we write the mass of the excited particle as <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\mu" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\mu" title="\mu" /></a> rather than m. So, our equation now looks like: <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\boxed{\frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu\phi)^2-\frac{1}{2}\mu^2\phi^2}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\boxed{\frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu\phi)^2-\frac{1}{2}\mu^2\phi^2}" title="\boxed{\frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu\phi)^2-\frac{1}{2}\mu^2\phi^2}" /></a>. Its high time for me to appologize for my notations, the two <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\mu" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\mu" title="\mu" /></a> in the above equation are two completely different things. The <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\mu" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\mu" title="\mu" /></a> in the derivative is just an index taking values 0,1,2,3, whereas the <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\mu" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\mu" title="\mu" /></a> in the potential energy term is what gives us the mass of the particle that is produced as a result of the excitation of the field.Now, its time for us to apply Euler equation. But here in case of QFT, it becomes:<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\boxed{\partial_\mu\left(\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial(\partial_\mu\phi)}\right)-\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\phi}=0}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\boxed{\partial_\mu\left(\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial(\partial_\mu\phi)}\right)-\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\phi}=0}" title="\boxed{\partial_\mu\left(\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial(\partial_\mu\phi)}\right)-\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\phi}=0}" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;So, applying this to our simple scalar field lagrangian, we get:
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\partial^2_\mu\phi&space;-&space;\mu^2\phi=0" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\partial^2_\mu\phi&space;-&space;\mu^2\phi=0" title="\partial^2_\mu\phi - \mu^2\phi=0" /></a>.
 This is what we can call the equation of motion of the field. This equation looks somewhat like the equation of motion of a SHO <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}-\omega^2x=0" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}-\omega^2x=0" title="\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}-\omega^2x=0" /></a>, where <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=x\rightarrow\phi" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x\rightarrow\phi" title="x\rightarrow\phi" /></a> &nbsp; and <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=t\rightarrow&space;x^\mu" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?t\rightarrow&space;x^\mu" title="t\rightarrow x^\mu" /></a>.
</p>
<p>So, if in the equation, the sign of the second term is negative, as in here <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\partial^2_\mu\phi&space;-&space;\mu^2\phi=0" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\partial^2_\mu\phi&space;-&space;\mu^2\phi=0" title="\partial^2_\mu\phi - \mu^2\phi=0" /></a>,then the system is perfectly straight forward. The cup like potential is curved upwards, the field is in stable equilibrium. Any disturbance will make the field oscillate. There will be energy involved in the oscillation, as the field increases and decreases, and the disturbance (the particle), will have a mass <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\mu" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\mu" title="\mu" /></a>, which is real. If for some reason the second term became zero,the mass term shall disappear, and the lagrangian would be <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\mathcal{L}=\frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu\phi)^2" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\mathcal{L}=\frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu\phi)^2" title="\mathcal{L}=\frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu\phi)^2" /></a>. In that case we will have a massless particle with no potential energy involved. It is a bit like a ball rolling on a flat surface. The field could still be excited, but as the field goes up and down, no potential energy would be involved! Now, if for some reason the mass <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\mu" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\mu" title="\mu" /></a> becomes imaginary (we will see later), this shall make <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\mu^2<0" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\mu^2<0" title="\mu^2<0" /></a>, so we will have a positive sign instead of a negative sign before the second term (the one containing <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\phi^2" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\phi^2" title="\phi^2" /></a> term). It would be very strange, like a ball on the top of a hill.Somehow the field would be unstable. We will get back to this later! So, this is the basic of the Higgs Field Lagrangian.
