<p>This post is going to be a little different from the other posts on my page till now. I intend to provide a more theoretical insight into Higgs Physics. The post is still going to be very basic in terms of level of understanding, however it might require a bit of an expertise in basic linear algebra, group theory, intermediate level classical mechanics, special relativity and quantum mechanics. I intend to write a future blog on the Experimental Side of Higgs Physics too, but that is for another time. Without any further delay lets get started with our new journey of understanding the Higgs!</p>

As I discussed in my past blog posts [The Standard Model and Beyond](https://snigdhochakraborty.github.io/SUSY/), and [What's SUSY all about?](https://snigdhochakraborty.github.io/susy_rpv/), Higgs was the last piece of puzzle to be found that completed the Standard Model on the 4th of April,2012. But today, we are going to take a look what it actually means when we say things like: 'The Higgs Field gives mass to all the fundamental particles' or, 'the Higgs boson, quanta of the Higgs Field has a mass of 124GeV due Higgs self coupling/interaction.' on a theoretical ground. Although this post shall focus on the Higgs Field or the Higgs Boson, we are going to discuss in here about a lot of general stuff applicable for all other fermions/bosons in order to provide a basic understanding!

<h2>Prelude</h2>
 The Standard Model comprises of fermions, the matter particles, and the bosons, the force carriers. Each boson in the standard model is known to provide some quantum number (kind of an identification number) to each of the fermions. the interaction with the gluon fields is what gives quarks theire color charge. Similarly the interaction with the photon field gives rise to electrical charge, and the interaction with the weak force fields (the W, and the Z boson fields) give rise to the weak isospin charge to all the fermions. But the standard model without the Higgs predicts that all the gauge bosons in the standard model should be massless. However it was found from the  [UA1 and UA2](https://public-archive.web.cern.ch/en/research/UA1_UA2-en.html) experiments at CERNâ€™s Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) in 1983 that infact the <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=Z^{0}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Z^{0}" title="Z^{0}" /></a>, and <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=W^{\pm}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?W^{\pm}" title="W^{\pm}" /></a> bosons do have large mass of around 91 GeV and 80GeV respectively. The puzzle was solved with the introduction of a new scalar field into the theory the Higgs Field, whose excitation gives rise to the Higgs boson. Perhaps there is question to why the fermions have mass, because the standard model for a different reason predicts that they should also be massless, and they are not. But that is a different question and we'll come to that too eventually. So let's get started!
<h2>The Lagrangian method to understand Quantum Fields</h2>
<p>This is a very interesting and simple outline to a method in mathematics that shall help us in understanding Quantum Field in order to answer the question: why or how the Higgs field has such a dramatic effect in changing the masses of the particles from 0 to the ones we observe.<br>
In classical physics when we describe the mechanics of a system, we often use what is called the 'Lagrangian'. It is just a function that summarizes you about the dynamics of the system, and allows you to solve what is actually going on. It is written by taking the Kinetic energy of a system, and subtracting from it the potential energy of the system: <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=L=T-V" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?L=T-V" title="L=T-V" /></a>. In classical physics, generally <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=T" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?T" title="T" /></a>, and <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=V" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?V" title="V" /></a> are functions of position and velocity. Then, we can apply what we call the Euler Equation on the Lagrangian, to derive its equations of motion. In classical mechanics it is written as:<br>
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\boxed{\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial&space;L}{\partial\dot{x}}\right)-\frac{\partial&space;L}{\partial&space;x}=0}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\boxed{\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial&space;L}{\partial\dot{x}}\right)-\frac{\partial&space;L}{\partial&space;x}=0}" title="\boxed{\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial\dot{x}}\right)-\frac{\partial L}{\partial x}=0}" /></a><br>
 These two equations, are the only ones we need to solve a system. </p> In case you are not already familiar with Lagrangian dynamics that I summarized here, you can refer to the notes and the example in here to understand what it actualy means: [Notes](http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~djmorin/chap6.pdf), [Pendulum Example](http://www.aoengr.com/Dynamics/LagrangianMechanicsPendulum.pdf). Now, when we come to the Standard Model, we will be dealing with fields and not solid objects as we saw previously. Moreover these are going to be Quantum Fields and not classical Fields. But it turns out there exists a similar kind of approach, a Lagrangian method, applicable to quantum fields as well. I would simply ask you to trust me and accept it without going into much of a detail. 
 <p>But before getting into that let me try to answer a few questions that might have cropped into your mind.
<ul>
 <li>What kinds of fields will we be talking about?</li>
 <li>How can we have a Lagrangian for a field?</li>
 <li>How can a field have Kinetic and Potential energy?</li>
 </ul>
 So, as we discussed before, the particles in the Standard Model are simply the excitation of their respective fields. These fields are present in all of space, even in empty space (having a value of 0). If energy is given to it to excite it, it can produce ripples, or disturbances from its zero value (the particle). The mss of the particle will come from some of the energy we give by Einstein's famous equation <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=E=mc^2" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?E=mc^2" title="E=mc^2" /></a>. So, we are going to be interested in a lots of different fields, which break down into three main types:<ul><li>Fermion Field: When excited will form a Spin-1/2 particle. Eg: The Electron field</li>
<li>Vector Field: When excited will form a Spin-1 particle (a Gauge Boson). Eg: The Photon field or the Electromagnetic field</li>
<li>Scalar Field: When excited will form a Spin-0 particle (Scalar Boson). Eg: The Higgs field</li></ul>
The first of these the <b>Fermion field</b> or better known as the <b>Dirac Field</b>. These are represented by <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\psi" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\psi" title="\psi" /></a>. This describes the lepton and the quark fields that produce spin-1/2 particle upon excitation. The Dirac Equation, was the first equation to marry special relativity and quantum mechanics sensibly. The Dirac equation can be written down as:<br>
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\boxed{i\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu\psi-m\psi=0}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\boxed{i\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu\psi-m\psi=0}" title="\boxed{i\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu\psi-m\psi=0}" /></a><br>
I donot want you at this stage to get intimidated by this equation. I donot expect you to understand what this equation means at this stage, rather just want you to realize that here <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\psi" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\psi" title="\psi" /></a> is a fermionic field, which upon excitation produces a fermion of mass <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=m" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m" title="m" /></a>. Quickly moving on to the <b>Vector Field</b>, that is the fields for Spin-1 bosons. If we say talk about electromagnetic field: denoted by <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=A" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?A" title="A" /></a>. We can use mathematics to derive the value of electric and magnetic field at a point from the information stored in  <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=A" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?A" title="A" /></a>, which we can measure. Clearly the <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=A" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?A" title="A" /></a> field is not just a number that gives a value at any <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=(x,y,z)" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?(x,y,z)" title="(x,y,z)" /></a>. It also has to describe the direction of this special kind of field at at any point, in space and time. It is known as the  Electromagnetic 4 potential: with <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=A_\mu\equiv(A_0,\vec{A})" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?A_\mu\equiv(A_0,\vec{A})" title="A_\mu\equiv(A_0,\vec{A})" /></a>. <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=A_0" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?A_0" title="A_0" /></a> is the electric scalar potential, and <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\vec{A}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\vec{A}" title="\vec{A}" /></a> is the magnetic vector potential with 3-components along the coordinate axes. </p>
