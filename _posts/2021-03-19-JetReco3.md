<h4><b>Building inputs to jet Reconstruction</b></h4>
So, in a detector, jets are a complex mixture of visible signals. Individual charged particles (which comprise of ~2/3 rd of the jets) appear in the tracker, wheras Charged and neutral particles (~1/3rd of the jets) appear together (but not distinguishable) in the calorimeter.
So, calorimeter energy deposit is the key to jet reconstruction. But the calorimeter is succeptible to a lot of pileup as we saw previously. So, the we need to design some calorimeter objects
in order to  reduce pileup effects, within limits.

Clusters of calorimeter energy are classic objects for Jet  Reconstruction! The lateral and longitudinal segmentation of the calorimeters permits three-dimensional reconstruction 
of particle showers, implemented in the topological clustering algorithm. Topo-clusters of calorimeter cells are seeded by cells whose absolute energy measurements |E| exceed 
the expected noise (the expected noise includes both electronic noise and the average contribution from pile-up, which depends on the run 
conditions)by four times its standard deviation. The topo-clusters are then expanded both laterally and longitudinally in two steps, first by iteratively adding all adjacent cells with absolute energies two standard 
deviations above noise, and finally adding all cells neighbouring the previous set, just to catch the tail of the distributions. FOrmation of calorimeter topocluster reduces pileup
to certain dergree. Nonetheless, pileup still impacts clusters. Eg: If pileup and hard scatter directly overlap, their energies are combined, changing the measured cluster energy. Also
pileup can create separate topoclusters. <br>
So, what about tracks? Do they give us proper jet reconstruction? Althought tracks are "inherently" pileup stable, tracks give an idea about only ~2/3rd
of the jet energy. The other thing is that tracks can give precise idea about energy and momentum of a charged particle only at low p<sub>T</sub>. This is because, 
at high p<sub>T</sub>, the ability to measure track curvature degrades. On the other hand, Calorimeters are sensitive to high energy deposits, and relatively insensitive to low energy deposits.
<br>Hence, neither tracks, nor calo clusters can form a good reconstruction object. So, we combine the information from both these to reconnstruct our jets. We can thus consider mixtures of tracks and calorimeter clusters.
This requires matching tracks to clusters so we don't double-count energy. Once we have matched track(s) to a cluster, we check if their measurements are consistent. If they are consistent, the cluster likely corresponds to only charged particle(s)
, else the cluster likely corresponds to overlapping charged and neutral particles. This process is typically called <b>"particle flow" or (PFlow)</b>. Once again particle 
flow is very detector-specifc, and each collaboration has their own algorithm, but the general idea and approach follows the above mentality. The figure below beautifully illustrates 
the way the PFlow algorithm works.
