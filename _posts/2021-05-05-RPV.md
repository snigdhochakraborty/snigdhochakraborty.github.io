As I discussed in one of my past blog post [<b>The Standard Model and Beyond</b>](https://snigdhochakraborty.github.io/SUSY/), the Standard Model of particle physics is a Quantum Field Theory  that describes the fundamental bulding blocks of nature, and how they behave. It includes the fermions (three pairs of quarks and three pairs of leptons), and the fundamental force carriers, the bosons that bring in the interaction amongst these fields. Now, in order to ensure that the Standard Model Lagrangian in local gauge invariant and renormalizable, these force particles have to be all massless. However, the [UA1 and UA2](https://public-archive.web.cern.ch/en/research/UA1_UA2-en.html) experiments at CERNâ€™s Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) in 1983 confirmed the historic discovery of the W and Z bosons having masses of around 80 GeV and 91 GeV respectively. A solution to this was proposed by Peter Higgs and his contemporaries:  Gauge bosons acquire masses in a local gauge invariant manner through spontaneous symmetry breaking. There are more ellaborate discussions about this in these papers- [Paper 1](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.13.321) ; [Paper 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0031916364911369?via%3Dihub) ; [Paper 3](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.13.508) ; and [Paper 4](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.13.585). The theory predicted an additional field, the Higgs Field with a corrsponding massive Spin 0  particle called the Higgs Boson. The interaction of fundamental particles with the Higgs Field gave them their mass. The Higgs boson interacts with the gauge bosons, with the fermions, and has cubic and quartic self-interactions (responsible for the mass of the Higgs boson).
