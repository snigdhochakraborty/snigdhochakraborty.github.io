<h4><b>Understanding Detector and Pileup</b></h4><br>

<br>Before we move on to the section of Pileup Mitigation, it is important to understant our detector structure.<br>
The ATLAS detector provides nearly full solid angle coverage around the collision point with an inner tracking system covering the pseudorapidity1 range <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mo stretchy="false">|</mo></mrow><mi>&#x03B7;<!-- η --></mi><mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mo stretchy="false">|</mo></mrow><mo>&lt;</mo><mn>2.5</mn></math>, electromagnetic (EM) and hadronic calorimeters

<br><br>The ATLAS <b>tracking system</b> is composed of a silicon pixel tracker closest to the beamline, a microstrip silicon tracker, and a straw-tube transition radiation tracker. These systems are layered radially around each other in the central region. A thin solenoid surrounding the tracker provides an axial 2T field enabling measurement of charged-particle momenta.
<br> The calorimeter is comprised of multiple subdetectors with different designs. The high granularity liquid argon (LAr) <b>electromagnetic calorimeter</b> system includes 
separate barrel, endcap, and forward subsystems. The tile <b>hadronic calorimeter</b> is composed of scintillator tiles and iron absorbers. The final layer is a <b>toroid muon 
spectrometer (MS)</b> that tracks muons. Generally, we use jets having  <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mo stretchy="false">|</mo></mrow><mi>&#x03B7;<!-- η --></mi><mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mo stretchy="false">|</mo></mrow><mo>&lt;</mo><mn>2.8</mn></math> such that they are fully contained within 
the barrel and endcap calorimeter systems.
<br><br> Now, once we are done with understanding detetctor structure of ATLAS, we'll head towards what is pileup, and how do we get rid of them. There are many 
p-p collisions taking place simultaneously, and within small interval of time at the Large Hadron Collider, so as to get more and more data. But multiple interactions 
in the same bunch crossings, and multiple bunch crossings within small time interval increases pileup. Pile-up contributes to the detector signals from the 
collision environment, and is especially important for higher-intensity operations of the LHC. The figure below represents a typical LHC event. Each blob that we see is a reconstructed
primary vertex ('point of collision of two protons'). However each of them is not a hard scatter (deep inelastic collisions with high energy) vertex. <br><br>
<img align="left" src="/assets/images/2.png" alt="drawing" style="width:800px;"/><br>Hence, pileup can be of two major types:
<ul><li><b>In Time pileup (IT):</b> This contribution arises from the additional proton–proton (pp) collisions occurring in the same bunch crossing as the hard-scatter interaction (deep inelastic collisions with high energy).</li>
<li><b>Out Of Time pileup (OOT):</b> This is the pile-up from signal remnants in the ATLAS calorimeters from the energy deposits in other bunch crossings.</li>
</ul>
While pileup directly cannot be measured, it can be correlated to many directly measurable quantities, such as <b>average number of collisions per bunch crossing (<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>&#x03BC;<!-- μ --></mi></math>)</b>, or 
<b>The observed number of collisions in a single event (<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>N</mi><msub><mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mi>P</mi><mi>V</mi></mrow></msub></math>)</b>, also known as Number of primary Vertices.
Since in time pileup arise from simultaneous collisions in one buch crossing, NPV can be thought as a measure of IT. On the other hand Out of time pileups arise from 
remenants of signal in subsequent or previous collisions, <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>&#x03BC;<!-- μ --></mi></math> can be thought of as a measure of OOT pileup. Now, at this point a question might bug us that
why should previous/subsequent collisions matter? It is if detector readout time is larger than the space between subsequent bunch crossings, previous, or subsequent events can overlap with current events
, hence giving a wrong reconstruction. Generally, calorimeters have a longer readout, but the tracking systems have a shorter readout time.
