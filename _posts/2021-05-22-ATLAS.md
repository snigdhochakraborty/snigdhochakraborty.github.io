<h3>My journey to ATLAS-2021</h3>
Getting an internship in ATLAS, one of the 4 major detectors of the Large Hadron collider (LHC), CERN was like a dream come true. The year of 2020, I applied for a project position
at the University of Geneva for the summer of 2021, and fortunately got selected! I started my work from the December of 2020. 
<p>In this section I'll keep appending basically all of the <b>Analysis</b> techniques and methods I learn and perform for the entire duration of the project :)</p>


<h3>R-Parity Violation Supersymmetry Analysis in ATLAS</h3>
I have discussed about Supersymmetry in the [<b>Particle Physics</b>](http://127.0.0.1:4000/partphy/) section! Here I'll discuss about R-parity violation coupling and the analysis work
and strategies that I am learning and following for this ATLAS project of 2020-2021.

<h4>The signal model</h4>
<p><img align="left" src="/assets/images/fig_01a-1.png" alt="drawing" style="width:200px;"/> This is our signal model, also known as the 6-jet model. The feynman diagram adjoining clearly specifies that there is a 
gluino pair production via R-parity conservation coupling, since a Standard model particle must have produced a pair of SUSY particle. Each of these gluinos now decay into a three quarks via <b>R-paity 
violation coupling</b>. So, in each event, there are six quarks produced, that hadronize to produce [jets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_(particle_physics)) (which are basically spray of particles that hit the detector). </p>


<h4>Why did we traget gluino pair production? </h4>
<img align="right" src="/assets/images/gg.jpg" alt="drawing" style="width:300px;"/> Production cross-sections (which can be considered as a 'measure' of probability that the process shall occur)
at the LHC are shown in the adjoining figure as a function of the sparticle mass. As expected the pair production of gluinos dominates the SUSY production for a given mass
scale, followed by the production of squarks, elecroweakinos, sleptons, and sneutrinos. This is exactly why we target gluino pair production. The fist signatures of SUSY is more probable to show up
via gluino pair production.
<p> A valid question to ask is <b>why didn't we observe a SUSY event so far?</b> The answer to this is, lack of statistics! Supersymmetry processes are very rare, they occur with
much lower crossection than the Standard Model processes, hence small statistics ensures masking of the signal (in our case any SUSY process) by the much more probable background processes (the Standard Model Processes).</p>

<br><br>
<h4>Backgrounds for our signal model?</h4>
Our signal model concerns Gluino pair production decaying via R-parity violation coupling in all hadronic final states. So, the background must contain those processes that have all hadronic final states too.
The first and the most important background for this is: <b>QCD Multijet Background</b>, since at a hadron collider the production of multijets through QCD interaction is the highest cross-section SM process.
The other fairy important backgrounds involve <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>t</mi><mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mover><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy="false">&#x00AF;<!-- Â¯ --></mo></mover></mrow></math> events, single top, and W/Z + jets.

<p>When we model a background we generally rely on Monte Carlo simulations. But with QCD it is harder, because the processes have huge cross sections so no matter how much CPU we put at work to simulate the events, we almost always end up with too few 
good events to do a proper modeling job. But this is not the case for other major backgrounds, like the once discussed above. So how do we go with modelling our QCD background?</p>

<br><br>
<h4>Data Driven Background Estimation</h4>
One solution to the problem that I raised in the previous section is what is popularly known as <b>"Data Driven Background Estimation"</b>. What this means is that we estimate the background from the data itself, without relying on our Monte Carlo,  although often these estimates also use some simulation-based information. Now at first it might seem to be very weird, as in how do we know if our data contains signal or not alongside backgroud? There are many types of data driven estimate, and the process is quite subjective to which method we are using.
<br>
<h3>The ABCD method of background estimation</h3>
<p><img align="right" src="https://cms-opendata-workshop.github.io/workshop-lesson-abcd-method/assets/img/abcd_diagram.png" alt="drawing" style="width:300px;"/> The main idea behind the ABCD method is illustrated in the diagram here. In order to find the background estimate in the signal region D, we estimate the background in a relatively signal free region called the control region C. But usually there can be some differences in the selection efficiency for the background process between regions C and D. To account for these differences, the estimate obtained in region C is corrected by so-called transfer factors. This transfer factor can be calculated from the data, as well as by the use of some Monte Carlo. The former is a fully data driven estimate, while the later is dependent on simulation parameters, hence is more prone to risk that the results are incorrect due to some incorrect model or assumption used in the simulations. Lets understand this in a bit more detail.</p>
