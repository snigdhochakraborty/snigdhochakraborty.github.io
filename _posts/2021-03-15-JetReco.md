This is the Data pipeline of CERN. All the data collected from the four major detectors ATLAS, CMS, ALICE and LHCb first undergo an online event selection, before being stored.
This raw data enters into the jet reconstruction process, where these are converted into analytically more useful information. This is kind of an offline selection to the data. 
This data then is ready to be analysed for the search and validations to be performed by the physicists.<br>

In this blog post I intend to draw a rough picture of the reconstruction of jets as performed by ATLAS and CMS, with slight bias on algorithms used by ATLAS. However, the general
procedure is almost the same in both of these collaborations. Before getting into jet reconstruction, it is important to understand, what are [jets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_(particle_physics)) ? Jets are actually 'tools' that 
represent hadronic showers in a detector. They are not real objects, rather represent hadronization of quarks and gluons. We classify jets as:
<ul><li><b>Small R jets:</b> These are jets with R=0.4. They originate from quarks and gluons.</li><li><b>Large R jets:</b> These are jets with R=1.0 for ATLAS and 0.8
for CMS. They originate from more complex objects such as hadronically decaying W/Z bosons, or top quark, etc.</li></ul>

<h3>Basic Steps of Jet Reconstruction</h3>
The process of jet reconstruction somewhat varies to a definite degree for different collaborations. But the underlying processes are almost always the same. As specified before,
this page has a bias on the method followed by ATLAS Collaboration. So we'll first try to <b>understand the structure of the ATLAS detector, and pileups</b>, which play a major role in understanding jet 
reconstruction process. After this we'll motivate the need to <b>construct objects for jet reconstruction</b> in order to mitigate pilrups. Following this we'll try 
o understand the next two major and crucial steps in jet reconstruction, namely <b>Jet Callibration</b>, and <b>Comparing data and Monte Carlo </b>. This will be the plan till the 
penultimate blog post on the series, following which I'll try to wind up with some interesting and unique stuff we do for large R jets specifically!
