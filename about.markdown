I am a 4th year BS-MS student at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Kolkata, India. I'm majoring in Physics and am a particle physics enthusiast. 
This website is my way of connecting to people and telling them my experiences and stories, and small stuff that I learn working in the field. The aim of this website
is not just documenting my journey in the field, but also inspiring other students who might have a similar vision of choosing Science and Research in Particle Physics in future.
